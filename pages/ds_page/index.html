During my university years, I successfully passed the interview and selection process to join the school-enterprise cooperation class, where I served as the class leader. This opportunity led to my internship at the Guangxi Institute of Geographic Information and Surveying, where I participated in projects such as the Third National Land Survey (China's Third Survey) and the National Geographic Conditions Monitoring. I was primarily responsible for geographic data collection and processing, GIS map creation and updates, visual interpretation of remote sensing images, and updating land parcel polygon codes. These experiences enhanced my practical skills in geographic information technology, data processing, and spatial analysis, while providing a solid foundation for my future career development in this field.       </p>
